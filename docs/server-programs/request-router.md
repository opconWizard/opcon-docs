# SMA Request Router

The SMA Request Router component reads the OpCon database to process
requests from the SAM and the Enterprise Manager. After retrieving the
record, the SMA Request Router sends the information to the designated
handler to process the request. When the handler finishes processing the
request, the SMA Request Router writes the completion information to the
OpCon database.

![SMA Request Router](../Resources/Images/Server-Programs/smarequestrouter.png "SMA Request Router")

## Request Handlers

The following Request Handlers execute OpCon requests:

- [SMASchedMan](#SMASched)
- [LSAMDATARETRIEVER](#LSAMDATA)
- [BIRTPROCESSOR](#BIRTPROC)
- [SAPQUERYPROCESSOR](#SAPQUERY)
- [SAPBWQUERYPROCESSOR](#SAPBWQUE)

### SMASchedMan

The SMASchedMan requests handler builds, checks, and deletes schedules.
For information on configuring SMASchedMan as a Request Handler to the
SMA Request Router, refer to [Request Handler 01](#Request2)
.

#### Processing Schedule Builds

When processing schedule build requests, SMASchedMan builds the
schedules into the Daily tables for the selected dates.

- SMASchedMan evaluates all Multi-instance and SubSchedule settings to
    build the required schedule instances based on the request.
  - For each named instance of a schedule that it builds,
        SMASchedMan creates a property called InstanceName that contains
        the name of "this" schedule instance.
    - The property is built as:
            [InstanceName=xxxxx]{style="font-family: 'Courier New';"}         -   The property can be used at runtime in job events.
- The jobs of a schedule must qualify for the selected date(s) to be
    included with the build.
  - For each job in each schedule, SMASchedMan loads the calendar
        for the schedule and any shared holiday calendars (including
        Master), and qualifies the job based on frequency settings for a
        specific date.
  - If a job has the flag set to "Disable Build", SMASchedMan will
        not include the job with the schedule.
  - When building a subschedule, if no jobs qualify for the day,
        SMASchedMan creates a Null job called SubScheduleNullJob to
        ensure the subschedule will build and the Container job can
        Finish OK.

#### Processing Schedule Checks

When processing a CHECK, CHECK+, or CHECK- command:

- If a schedule contains a Container job, SMASchedMan inserts a new
    check/check+/check- request for the SubSchedule.
- If the specified Schedule Name is a Schedule Instance Name in the
    Daily tables, only that schedule will be checked.
- If the specified Schedule Name can be found in Administration,
    SMASchedMan will check all instances of the schedule for the
    specified date(s).

#### Processing Schedule Deletes

When processing a DELETE command:

- If a schedule contains a Container job, SMASchedMan inserts a new
    delete request for the subschedule.
- If the specified Schedule Name is a Schedule Instance Name in the
    Daily tables, only that schedule will be deleted.
- If the specified Schedule Name can be found in Administration,
    SMASchedMan will delete all instances of the schedule for the
    specified date(s).

#### Logging

- SMASchedMan always writes its log files to the \<Output
    Directory\>\\SAM\\Log\\SMASchedMan folder.
- If the SMASchedMan folder does not exist, SMASchedMan creates the
    folder before writing the log.
- The log file naming convention is:
    [ScheduleName_Command_YYYYMMDD]{style="font-family: 'Courier New';"}     -   ScheduleName is the name of the schedule that was supposed to
        build.
  - Command is Build, Check, Delete, or Forecast.
  - YYYYMMDD is the schedule date the schedule was supposed to build
        for.

### LSAMDATARETRIEVER

The LSAMDATARETRIEVER request handler processes requests from the Job
Output Retrieval System (JORS). The JORS enables users to view job
output in the graphical interfaces. For information on configuring the
LSAMDATARETRIEVER, refer to [Request Handler 02](#Request3)
.

### BIRTPROCESSOR

The BIRTPROCESSOR request handler processes requests to generate BIRT
reports. The BIRTPROCESSOR picks up the requests from the database and
calls the BIRT generator to create the corresponding reports. The
handler writes all report and log files to the \<Output
Directory\>\\SAM\\Log\\Reports folder. For information on configuring
the BIRTPROCESSOR, refer to [Request Handler 06](#Request4)
.

:::note
The Output Directory was configured during installation. For more information, refer to [File Locations](../file-locations.md) in the **Concepts** online help.
:::

### SAPQUERYPROCESSOR

The SAPQUERYPROCESSOR request handler processes requests from the
graphical interfaces to retrieve information from an SAP system. This
graphical interface requires this request handler for the creation of
SAP jobs. For information on *configuring the SAPQUERYPROCESSOR*, refer
to [Request Handler 03](#Request5).

### SAPBWQUERYPROCESSOR

The SAPBWQUERYPROCESSOR request handler processes requests from the
graphical interfaces to retrieve information from an SAP BW system. This
graphical interfaces require this request handler for the creation of
SAP BW jobs. For information on configuring the SAPBWQUERYPROCESSOR,
refer to [Request Handler 04](#Request6).

## Configuration

SMA Request Router configuration determines basic service and logging
behavior, and Request Handler definitions. The SMARequestRouter.ini file
resides in the \<Configuration Directory\>\\SAM\\ folder. The tables
contain the definitions of each configuration parameter. If a value of
"Y" is in the Dynamic column, any changes take effect immediately upon
saving the file. All other configuration settings require the service to
be restarted before the change takes effect.

:::note
The Configuration Directory location is based on where you installed your programs. For more information, refer to [File Locations](../file-locations.md) in the **Concepts** online help.
:::

### SMARequestRouter.ini

The SMARequestRouter.ini file contains the following major sections:

- [General Settings](#General)
- [Debug Options](#Debug)
- [Settings for Individual Request Handlers](#Request2)

#### General Settings

The General Settings contain basic information for SMA Request Router
processing.
