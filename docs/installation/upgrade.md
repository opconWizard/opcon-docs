# OpCon Server Upgrade

:::caution
Before beginning the upgrade, complete [Getting Started](./system-requirements.md).
:::

In order to complete the upgrade to this release, it is important to
complete all of the procedures in this topic from beginning to end.

## Upgrade the OpCon Server

To upgrade the OpCon Server, complete the procedures in this section in
the following order:

I.  [Prepare the Environment](#Prepare)

### Prepare the Environment

To prepare for installing the OpCon Server updates:

- [Back up the OpCon Database](#Back)
- [Stop Services and Manage Files](#Stop)
- [Stop and Disable Replication or Mirroring](#Stop2)

#### Back up the OpCon Database

SMA Technologies strongly recommends backing up the OpCon database before upgrading to the new release.

[Locate the Server in Management Studio]{.ul}
On the OpCon Database Server:

Use menu path: **Start \> All Programs \> Microsoft SQL Server \> SQL
Server Management Studio**.

On the Connect to Server screen:

Select **Database Engine** in the **Server type** list box.

Select the \[OpCon Database Server\] in the **Server name** list box.
In the Authentication section:

Choose your authentication type and provide credentials.

a.  Log in as **sa** if you choose *SQL Server Authentication* **-
    or -**
b.  Make sure the Windows User for Authentication has system
    administration privileges.

Click the **Connect** button.

In the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio window:

Expand (+) the **Databases** folder.

Identify the OpCon database.

Back Up the Database

1. Right-click the **OpCon database** and choose **Tasks \> Back Up**.
2. Go to the **Source** frame.
3. Confirm the **OpCon database** is selected and the **Backup type**
    is set to **Full**.
4. Go to the **Backup set** frame.
5. Enter the *backup job name* in the **Name** text box.
6. Go to the **Destination** frame.
7. Select the **Disk** radio button.
8. Click **Add** to add the location and name of the backup file if the
    default destination is not desired. You should see the default
    directory for SQL backups listed in the **Select Backup
    Destination** window.
9. Enter, in the **File name** text box, a *file name* followed by a
    *.bak* file extension at the end of the file path. If this is not
    the desired location, enter the *full path* and *file name* followed
    by a *.bak* file extension (e.g., D:\\MSSQL\\Backup\\Opconxps.bak).
10. Click **OK** to accept the backup (.bak) filename.
11. Click the **Options** tab in the **Select a page** menu.
12. Go to the **Overwrite media** frame.
13. Select the **Append to the existing backup set** or **Overwrite all
    existing backup sets** radio button. Either option is acceptable.
    The database administrator should make this decision.
14. Click **OK**.
15. When the backup completes successfully, click **OK**.
