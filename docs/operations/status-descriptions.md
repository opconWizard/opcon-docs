# Schedule and Job Status Descriptions and Allowed Status Changes

All schedules and jobs in Schedule Operations have a status. These statuses communicate what is happening and also determine what status changes are allowed.

## Schedule Statuses

The table contains definitions of OpCon schedule statuses. The last column contains permitted status changes.
