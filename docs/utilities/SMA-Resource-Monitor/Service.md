# SMA Resource Monitor Service

The SMA Resource Monitor service reads the Rule files to determine what
to monitor. When a monitored resource rule is met, the service reads the
Actn files to send OpCon events to the SAM.

:::note
When a mapped drive or UNC path is specified in File Name Path, the Resource Monitor Service needs to be running as a domain user who has access to mapped drives or the UNC path being monitored.

## Logging

:::note
The Output Directory was configured during installation. For more information, refer to [File Locations](../../file-locations.md) in the **Concepts** online help.
:::

The SMA Resource Monitor creates a single log file located in the:

\<Output Directory\>\\SMAResourceMonitor\\Log\\ directory.

The log file is named SMAResourceMonitor.log

The SMA Resource Monitor archives log files when they reach the maximum
log file size configured in the .ini file. All archived log files reside
in the:

\<Output Directory\>\\SMAResourceMonitor\\Log\\Archive folder.

If an archive folder for the day does not already exist, the SMA
Resource Monitor creates one. The folder names use the following naming
convention: yyyy_mm_dd (Weekday). The logging mechanism generates the
weekday name matching the format recognized by the regional settings of
the user running the SMA Resource Monitor service.

+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| ![White pencil icon on green     | **EXAMPLE:** [If the Regional    | | circular                         | Settings are set to English, an  |
| background](../../../Reso        | archive folder would have the    |
| urces/Images/example-icon(48x48) | following name: 2008_01_11       |
| .png "Example icon") | (Friday)]{.statement2}           |
|                                  |                                  |
|                                  |                                  |
|                                  |                                  |
|                                  | If the Regional Settings are set |
|                                  | to French, an archive folder     |
|                                  | would have the following name:   |
|                                  | 2008_01_11 (Vendredi)            |
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+

As a log file fills up, SMA Resource Monitor moves it to the current
archive folder and renames it using the following naming convention: SMA
Resource Monitor StartTime - StopTime.log.

:::tip Example
An SMA Resource Monitor archive file for the time range of 12:58:16 to 13:58:00 would be named SMAResourceMonitor 125816 - 135800.log.
:::

Once per day the SMA Resource Monitor deletes old archive folders. The
SMA Resource Monitor retains 10 days of archived logs by default. If
desired, change the Log Archive Max Retention setting in the .ini file.

## Configuration

The configuration for the SMA Resource Monitor service and UI is managed
through a single .ini file named SMAResouceMonitor.ini.

[Modify the SMAResourceMonitor.ini File]{.ul}

1. Right-click on **Start** and select **Explore** from the menu.
2. Browse to the \<Configuration Directory\>\\SMAResourceMonitor\\
    directory on the OpCon server.
3. Find the **SMAResourceMonitor.ini** file.
4. Right-click the file and select **Open With**.
5. Select an ASCII text editor (e.g., Notepad) from the **Choose the
    program you want use** list box.
6. Make any necessary modifications to the .ini file in the text
    editor. For complete information on the SMAResourceMonitor.ini
    settings, see the tables in the next section.
7. Use menu path: **File \> Save**.
8. **Close ☒** the text editor.

### SMAResourceMonitor.ini

The SMAResourceMonitor.ini file resides in the \<Configuration
Directory\>\\SMAResourceMonitor\\ directory.

:::note
The Configuration Directory location is based on where you installed your programs. For more information, refer to [File Locations](../../file-locations.md) in the **Concepts** online help.
:::

All settings in the configuration file apply to the machine on which the
file resides. The INI file contains the following major sections:
*General* and *Debug Options*.
