### Forward Slash Argument

The forward slash argument is supported for backwards compatibility with
cleardir.exe and can be used in the same way as the dash switches.

The following is an example of the command-line syntax:

SMADirectory.exe /d "c:\\Test" /r /u /e \*.\*

### Comma Delimited Argument

The comma delimited argument is supported for backwards compatibility
with the SMADeleteOldFiles and can only be used to delete files (not
move or compress them). This mode requires three (3) parameters to run
successfully.

The following command-line syntax can be used:

```shell
<Target Directory\>\\OpConxps\\MSLSAM\\SMADirectory.exe Directory,DaysToRetain,FileExtensions
```

#### Parameters

The following describes the command-line parameters:

- **<Target Directory\>**: The path to the OpCon installation folder
    (e.g., "C:\\Program Files\").
- **Directory**: The path to the directory to examine.
- **DaysToRetain**: The number of days to keep in the directory.
  - The counter must be entered in English. For example, 5d.
  - The value must be greater than zero, but less than 32,757.
- **FileExtensions**: The file extensions to apply this retention
    period to (e.g., "log" would look for files with the log
    extension).
  - One or more file extensions can be specified (separated by
        commas).
  - The wildcard (\*) character can be specified to apply this
        retention period to all files in this directory.

#### Example

:::tip Example
The following command line would delete any files with an extension of "log" that were older than 5 days:

```shell
"C:\Program Files\OpConxps\MSLSAM\SMADirectory"
```

```shell
"C:\ProgramData\OpConxps\SAM\Log,5,log"
```

Notice that there is no period in front of log.
