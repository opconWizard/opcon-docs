# Data Transformation Services (DTS)

[]{#aanchor604} Microsoft Data Transformation Services (DTS) transforms data from one database to another. [SMA
Technologies]{.GeneralCompanyName} has found some situations requiring
this procedure; however, there may be several other applicable
situations. DTS resolves the following issues:

- Databases that have been upgraded from MSSQL 7.0 to MSSQL 2000 (or
    higher) have an issue with a command in MSSQL 7.0 (and higher)
    called "TOP".
- Databases that are being moved from a Binary sort order to a
    non-Binary sort order may have collation conflicts (SQL error 446)
    during processing.

## Transforming a Database

To transform the database, address the following issues:

- Disconnect Applications
- Back Up the Database
- Run the Schema Installation Script

### Disconnecting Applications

Perform the DTS procedure on the machine where the OpCon database
resides. Before beginning the DTS procedure, disconnect all applications
from the OpCon database.

[Disconnection Applications from the OpCon Database]{.ul}

1. Log in as a *Windows user with Local Administrative Rights*.
2. Use menu path: **Start \> Control Panel**.
3. Double-click the **Administrative Tools** icon.
4. Double-click the **Server Manager** icon.
5. Expand (+) the **Configuration** option.
6. Double-click the **Services** icon.
7. Scroll down to the **SMA Service Manager** service.
8. Select **Stop** (â– ) on the toolbar.
9. Click **OK** to exit.
10. Exit all OpCon graphical interfaces.
11. Close any **SQL Server Management Studio** windows connected to the
    OpCon database.

### Backing up the Database

[Locate the Server in Management Studio]{.ul}
On the OpCon Database Server:

Use menu path: **Start \> All Programs \> SQL Server Management
Studio**.

On the Connect to Server screen:

Select **Database Engine** in the **Server type** drop-down list.

Select the desired \[OpCon Database Server\] in the **Server name** drop-down list.

Select one of the following options in the **Authentication**drop-down
list:

    box and the *sa's password* in the **Password** text box.

Click the **Connect** button.

In the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio window:

Expand (+) the **Databases** folder.

Identify the OpCon database.

[Back Up the Database]{.ul}

    default destination is not desired. You should see the default
    directory for SQL backups listed in the **Select Backup
    Destination** window.
10. Enter, in the **File name** text box, a *file name* followed by a
    *.bak* file extension at the end of the file path. If this is not
    the desired location, enter the *full path* and *file name* followed
    by a *.bak* file extension (e.g., D:\\MSSQL\\Backup\\Opconxps.bak).
11. Click **OK** to accept the backup (.bak) filename.
12. Click the **Options** tab in the **Select a page** menu.

### Running the Schema Installation Scripts

Now that the data has been transferred, run the database update scripts
through the SMA Database Configuration.

[Upgrade the OpCon Database]{.ul}
The DB_Update.cmd and DB_Update_WinAuth.cmd files execute the scripts to
update the database schema, data, and stored procedures for OpCon (refer
below). In the case of errors, the command file produces several output
files in the \<Output Directory\>\\SAM\\Log\\ directory to aid in
support. Each log file is named for its respective SQL script.

:::note
The Output Directory was configured during installation. For more information, refer to [File Locations](../../file-locations.md) in the **Concepts** online help.
:::

The following scripts are located in the \<Configuration
Directory\>\\Utilities\\Database\\ directory:

- Schema Installation Script
- SMALOOKUP Script
- Database Stored Procedures Script
- Database Functions Script
- PDSA Framework Scrip
- PDSA Framework Data Script

:::note
The Configuration Directory location is based on where you installed your programs. For more information, refer to [File Locations](../../file-locations.md) in the **Concepts** online help.
:::

For additional information on the SQL scripts, refer to [OpCon Database Scripts](../Installation/OpCon-Database-Scripts.md)
in the **OpCon Installation** online help.

#### Determine Command Line Parameters

After customizing the scripting variables command files, determine the
command line parameters required for executing the DB_Update.cmd or
DB_Update_WinAuth.cmd file.

If using [SQL Authentication]{.ul}, use the DB_Setup.cmd with the following syntax:

DB_Update.cmd PathToOpconDataDir userName userPassword

If using [Windows Authentication to SQL]{.ul}, use the DB_Setup_WinAuth.cmd file with the following syntax:

DB_Update_WinAuth.cmd PathToOpconDataDir

The following list describes the parameters for the commands:

- **PathToOpconDataDir:** The directory path of the \<Configuration
    Directory\>**\\Utilities\\Database\\** directory. Exclude the
    trailing backslash (\\) and always enclose this parameter in double
    quotes (e.g., "C:\\ProgramData\\OpConxps\\Utilities\\Database").
- **userName**: For the DB_Update.cmd file only, this is the user name
    with privileges to update the OpCon database.
- **saPassword**: For the DB_Update.cmd file only, this is the
    password for the userName defined in the previous parameter.

#### Execute the Command Script

:::note
To successfully execute the DB_Update_WinAuth.cmd file, the administrator must be logged in to the SAM application server as an Active Directory User with privileges to the "sysadmin" server role on the SQL Server.
:::

1. Use menu path: **Start \> Run**.
2. Enter *cmd* in the **Open** text box.
3. Click **OK**.
4. Change directories to the \<Configuration
    Directory\>**\\Utilities\\Database\\** directory by entering: cd
    OpConDatabaseScriptDir.
5. Enter *DB_Update.cmd* or *DB_Update_WinAuth.cmd* and the
    *parameters*.
6. Read the logs for each of the SQL scripts to verify success.

### Restarting Applications

After updating the database schema, restart the SMA Service Manager and
allow users to connect to the database. All OpCon processing should
continue normally.

[Start the SMA Service Manager]{.ul}

1. Use menu path: **Start \> Control Panel**.
2. Double-click **Administrative Tools**.
3. Double-click the **Services** icon.
4. Click **SMA Service Manager**.
5. Click **Start** on the toolbar to start the service.
6. Click **Close â˜’** on the **Services** window.
