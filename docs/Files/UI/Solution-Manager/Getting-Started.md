#  Getting Started

SMA Solution Manager is an application platform designed to host and
give access to User Interface (UI) modules called Solutions. Users will
see and have access only to the solution(s) to which they have
privileges.

 

Currently, the platform comes with the [Self Service](Working-with-Self-Service.md) solution, the
[Operations](Working-with-Operations.md) solution, and the
[Vision](Working-with-Vision.md) solution. In the future, more
solutions will be available.

Each page URL contains information, such as the current item ID edition, current selections, and filters, which make them ideal for bookmarking or sharing with others.]
