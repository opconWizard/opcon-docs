#  Using Escalation Acknowledgment

The **Escalation Acknowledgment** view is used to view and acknowledge
[escalation]{.GeneralEscalatedNotification}s. For more information on how to set up [escalation]{.GeneralEscalatedNotification} rules, refer
to [Using Escalation Manager](Using-Escalation-Manager.md).

 

When on the **Escalation Acknowledgment** screen, it lists any
[escalation]{.GeneralEscalatedNotification}s that have not been acknowledged. The screen shows the following information for each
[escalation]{.GeneralEscalatedNotification}: 
-   **Date**: The date of the
    [escalation]{.GeneralEscalatedNotification}. -   **Notification**: The subject of the email notification pending
    acknowledgment.
-   **Escalation Level**: The current level of the
    [escalation]{.GeneralEscalatedNotification}, as defined in the rule     sequence.
-   **Status**: The current state of the
    [escalation]{.GeneralEscalatedNotification}'s acknowledgment.     Status has two states:
    -   **Pending**: An [escalation]{.GeneralEscalatedNotification} is         awaiting acknowledgment and has been sent to one or more groups
        of users who are part of the
        [escalation]{.GeneralEscalatedNotification} rule.     -   **Exhausted**: An [escalation]{.GeneralEscalatedNotification}
        has been sent to all groups of users in the rule, but has not
        been acknowledged.
