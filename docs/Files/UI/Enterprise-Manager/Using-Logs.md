# Using Logs

[]{#aanchor282} The **Logs** option provides links to display the [SAM server log files](Types-of-Logs.md). To enable this feature, you
must share the **OpConxps** folder on the SAM server and configure the
Enterprise Manager connection profile to point to that directory. For
more information, refer to [[Setting up New Profiles](Managing-Connection-Profiles.md)]{.Hyperlink}. It is also
possible to set certain user preferences relating to the displays within
the log files. For more information about setting preferences for the
log files, refer to [[Setting Preferences for Log Viewer](Preferences-for-Log-Viewer.md)]{.Hyperlink}.

## Logs Toolbar and Right-Click Menu

The **Logs** also have a standard toolbar that allows you to perform
functions for managing the logs. Click on any specific icon on the
toolbar below to learn more about its functionality.

Note that the toolbar options are also available via right-click
functionality. You need only right-click inside any log that you are
currently viewing to access the context menu with these options.
