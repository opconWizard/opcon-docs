# Working with External Tools

[]{#aanchor155} Once the [OpCon installation directory has been
configured](Configuring-the-Installation-Directory.md) in the
Enterprise Manager, you can utilize the **External Tools** feature. This
feature gives you the opportunity to open external tools easily without
having to move focus away from the Enterprise Manager. You can also [add other relevant external tools](Adding-External-Tools.md) to the
list of tools.

Click on any **External Tools** [function item[[]{.MCTextPopupArrow}Fuction items are displayed as icons with
descriptions in the Navigation Panel.]{.MCTextPopupBody
.MCTextPopupBody_Closed .needs-pie .popupBody
aria-hidden="true"}](javascript:void(0)){.MCTextPopup .popup .popupHead}
in the graphic to learn more about that item.
