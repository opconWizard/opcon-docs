## Types of Navigation {#types-of-navigation style="margin-top: 24pt;"}

Under each navigation topic, the [function list[[]{.MCTextPopupArrow}The function list is represented by icons with
descriptions.]{.MCTextPopupBody .MCTextPopupBody_Closed .needs-pie
.popupBody aria-hidden="true"}](javascript:void(0)){.MCTextPopup .popup
.popupHead} provides two types of navigation:

- [Navigation Editors](Navigation-Editors.md)
- [Navigation Views](Navigation-Views.md)

Throughout the navigation process, you can customize the look and feel
of the Enterprise Manager workspace to suit your individual needs, and
multiple [Editors](Navigation-Editors.md) and
[Views](Navigation-Views.md) can be opened at one time. This
customized layout can be [saved and restored at the next startup](Preferences-from-EM.md#To_always_re-open_the_current_information)
of the Enterprise Manager.
