# Event Notification

Event Notification in OpCon is a process in
which Machine, Schedule, and Job status change events generate (i.e.,
trigger) notifications. For critical notifications, administrators can
also apply [escalation]{.GeneralEscalatedNotification} rules to provide higher visibility.

The basic types of notifications include Windows Event Log, Email
(SMTP), Network Message, SNMP Trap, Unisys Single Point of Operations
(SPO) AL and CO Reports, Text Messages (SMS), OpCon/xps Events, and
Command. With OpCon, notifications can be
created in several ways. Refer to [Notification Events](https://help.smatechnologies.com/opcon/core/latest/OpCon-Events/Event-Types.md#Notifica)
 in the **OpCon Events** online help.
