#  Escalation

An [escalation]{.GeneralEscalatedNotification} in OpCon is a notification that has been marked
for recurring notification, with an
[escalation]{.GeneralEscalatedNotification} rule, to one or more groups of people (defined within [escalation]{.GeneralEscalatedNotification}
groups). The [escalation]{.GeneralEscalatedNotification} must be acknowledged to stop the [escalation]{.GeneralEscalatedNotification}
process. When someone acknowledges an
[escalation]{.GeneralEscalatedNotification}, this indicates to OpCon that the user read the notification.
From there, it is up to the customer to take any required action.
